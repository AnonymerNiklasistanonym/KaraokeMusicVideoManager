# KaraokeMusicVideoManager
A software that scans folders after music videos, brings them together in a list and starts them. After this there will also come a website where people can say/post which song they want to do next.
## The goal:
This program doesn't reinvent the wheel, it is aimed to be a reliable, stable and small helper for you "karaoke evening". It scans folders after music videos that are formatted like this: "ARTIST - TITLE" and lists them for you in a searchable and sortable table. Also, you can export this list to a CSV (for Excel) or HTML file (for a website/to print).
## How to do anything?
The operation manual is really simple - there aren't many buttons and everywhere are tooltips and icons. The main thing is that under "Source folders" you can simply add directories or remove them and with the text field you can search the table. If you press enter the first-row video will be played with your default video player. But you can also press a row with the mouse and the music video of this row will be opened in the default video player too. If you see that there is now video, you can now also directly open in your default browser YouTube with the search query of the text field. With the button at the button the computer randomly opens one of the mapped videos if you approve the dialog.
## That's it?
Yes, for now. I will continue to add features and make my code better and understandable. Simply create issues or requests if you have good ideas. You can use this software without being sued too - but it would be nice that if you like it to recommend it to others :)

## Important Information:
Music video file name format (because I didn't program anything editable yet):
<html><table><tr><td>Artist</td><td>" - "</td><td>Title</td><td>.avi/.mp4/.mkv/.wmv/.mov</td></tr></table></html>

> If your files are not named like this contact me and I give the customizer a higher priority!
