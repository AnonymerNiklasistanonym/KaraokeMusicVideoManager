# IMAGE RECOURCES

Coming soon

<br>

- Install Python 3.* packages
  - Image manipulation with `pip install Pillow`
- Install Inkscape
  - Download the installer from https://inkscape.org/en/release/0.92.2/
  - After the installation should Inkscape already be usable over the command line without adding it to the environment variables

#### Do only this outside of the master shell script:

Run the script [create_image_ressources.py](../ImageResources/create_image_ressources.py) in the `ImageResources` folder.
*(Wait some seconds -> Inkscape needs it's time)*

------

âš 

IF you get any problems with Inkscape add the path to the `bin` folder of the `Inkscape` folder in `ProgramFiles` to the Windows environment variables.

Also be sure to use the newest available version of Inkscape because the old one had bugs and could not handle command line use very well on Windows.
