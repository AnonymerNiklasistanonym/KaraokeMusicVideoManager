### I am on Windows and can't test the `.php` files in my browser

Not really important on which operating system you are a simple server can be installed on every one.

On Windows I use and recommend XAMPP: [Link to Windows, Linux, Mac installer](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)

1. After installing it run it and click the button `start` or `run` next to the `Apache` label.
2. Next click the button `Exporer` and double click `htdocs` to get into the same folder.
3. Now place here all the files like before.
4. Start any browser on this PC and enter `127.0.0.1` and after that the file path to the html/php file as if `127.0.0.1` is the whole path `c:/..../htdocs`.
5. Everything should work now.
